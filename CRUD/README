because when you wirk with prepare and every time ther is a new input 
Pdo will check and correct any missunderstanding


ERROR_MODE8EXCEPTION: when it blwo up it dies and do not continue exucutting


prepare and exucute put theme always in a try/catch

the best usage of errors is to print a simple msg for 
the user and make a file names "error4.php" where u put all errors

// for security we dont use query ---> fetch 
we use prepare --->execute
